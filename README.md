-  Hi, I’m Snéha. 
-  I’m interested in coding, machine learning, Indo-Aryan and Slavic langauges. 
-  I’m currently learning to be a concise writer (I am very wordy in writing). 
-  I’m looking to collaborate on open-source portfolios in Python and C++ for revision, contribution, and application. 
-  For any questions or thoughts, email me @sneharoym81@gmail.com
